# deep-neural-net-1

Python script containing the basic functionality to implement a deep neural network.
Mostly written for my own use, but you're welcome to use it if you find it helpful!

Contains the basic functions needed to implement a plain deep neural network.
Currently does not implement regularization, normalization, learning rate decay, or advanced optimization algorithms.
I will be adding these soon.

# USAGE

	import deep_neural_net_1 as dnn1
